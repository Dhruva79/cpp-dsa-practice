🧠 this Keyword in C++
this is a pointer that points to the current object of the class.

So this->size means: "the size variable that belongs to the current object".

🔁 Why do we use this->size = size;?
Because there's a name conflict.

The constructor parameter is named size.

The class member variable is also named size.

So if you just write:

cpp
Copy
Edit
size = size;
C++ assumes both refer to the parameter, and the assignment does nothing.

To fix this, you say:

cpp
Copy
Edit
this->size = size;
Which means:

this->size → class member variable

size → constructor parameter

So you're assigning the parameter to the object’s variable.
